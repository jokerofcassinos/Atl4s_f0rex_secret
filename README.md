# 🌌 Atl4s-Forex v1.0 (Legacy Stable) 🦅
> **"The Original Foundation. Stable, Proven, and Precise."**

Welcome to the **Legacy Branch (v1.0)** of Atl4s-Forex. This is the original, stable version of the bot before the introduction of dynamic sizing and automated installers.

## 🏆 Status: STABLE (Maintenance Mode)
This version is in **Maintenance Mode**. New features (like Dynamic Capital Scaling and Margin Checks) are developed in the `v2.0` branch.

**Use this version if:**
*   You prefer static lot sizes (configured manually).
*   You need a strictly stable environment with no new experimental changes.
*   You are running on an older setup that relies on the original architecture.

## ⚡ Core Features (v1.0)
*   **Swarm Scalp**: 1st Eye HFT Logic.
*   **Static Risk**: Risk is determined by `config.py` (Fixed Lots or Fixed Risk %).
*   **Manual Config**: Port and Trade Settings must be set in `config.py` before running.
*   **Execution**: Standard reliable bridge connection.
