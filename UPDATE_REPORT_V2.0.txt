# ATL4S-FOREX MASTER CHANGELOG
# ==========================================

## v2.3: The "Hyper-Scale" Upgrade (Current)
**Date:** January 2026
**Focus:** Dynamic Risk, Speed, and "Brain-Logic" Scaling.

### 1. 🧬 Hyper-Dynamic Risk Engine (Quantum Sigmoid)
The old linear risk model was too rigid. We introduced a biological scaling model:
-   **Power Law & Sigmoid Curve**: Capital scales non-linearly (`Equity^0.65`).
-   **Brain-Linked Risk**:
    -   **High Confidence (>90%)**: Boosts trade size by **1.5x**.
    -   **High Chaos (Entropy)**: Cuts trade size to protect capital.
-   **New Capacity**: Lot sizes can now scale smoothly up to **2.50 Lots** (previously capped at 0.50), but only under perfect conditions.

### 2. ⚡ Quantum Railgun 2.0 (Strict Tuning)
-   **"Impatient" Logic**: The extension logic was too lenient, causing waits on winning trades.
-   **Strict Thresholds**: Now requires **Explosive Velocity (>0.7)** to justify waiting. Otherwise, it takes the profit immediately.
-   **Greed Cap**: If profit exceeds **1.5x Target**, it force-closes instantly, preventing "round-tripping" gains.

### 3. 🛡️ Circuit Breakers & Safety
-   **Margin Safety**: Added explicit checks to ensure we never use >90% of free margin.
-   **Crash Guards**: Fixed `Unicode`, `TypeError`, and `AttributeError` bugs for 100% uptime stability.

---

## v2.2: The "Precision" Upgrade
**Focus:** Execution Accuracy and Oversold Protection.

### 1. 🛡️ Oversold/Overbought Protection
-   **Smart Timing**: If the bot wants to Sell but the market is **Oversold (Z-Score < -2.5)**, it **WAITS**.
-   **Benefit**: Eliminates "selling the bottom" and immediate drawdown.

### 2. 🔫 Quantum Railgun (v1.0)
-   Introduced the concept of **Velocity-Based Extension**.
-   Allows the bot to ignore the Take Profit line if momentum is smashing through it.

### 3. 🔧 Execution Fixes
-   **Invalid Volume (10014)**: Added "Gatekeeper" to block zero-volume trades.
-   **Invalid Stops (10016)**: Implemented "Sledgehammer" buffers (500 points) to guarantee broker acceptance.

---

## v2.1: The "Speed" Upgrade
**Focus:** Latency and Conflict Resolution.

### 1. ⚡ Latency Reduction
-   Reduced Analysis Cooldown from **1.0s** to **0.1s**.
-   Bot now reacts to price ticks in milliseconds.

### 2. 🧠 Smart Inversion (Trend Veto)
-   **River Alignment**: The "Tenth Eye" (Architect) is now forced to respect the H1 Trend.
-   If the H1 River is Bearish, the Architect CANNOT issue strong Buy signals (preventing "Hallucinations").

---

## v2.0: Deep Awakening (Base)
**Focus:** Core Architecture.
-   **Swarm Intelligence (Unified Field)**: Physics-based trading.
-   **Holographic Architect**: Multi-timeframe oversight.
-   **ZeroMQ Bridge**: High-speed Python-MetaTrader link.
