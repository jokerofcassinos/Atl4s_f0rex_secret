## Verdict: ✅ ALL EYES WELL DESIGNED

The Eyes are not the source of the performance regression.
All have proper:
- Threshold logic
- Safety checks
- Reasonable confidence scores
- No signal inversions

## Root Cause Reminder

The issue is NOT in the Eyes. It's in:
1. [scalper_swarm.py](file:///D:/Atl4s-Forex/analysis/scalper_swarm.py) line 142: `S = -S`
2. [swarm_orchestrator.py](file:///D:/Atl4s-Forex/core/swarm_orchestrator.py) line 454: Gate 3
